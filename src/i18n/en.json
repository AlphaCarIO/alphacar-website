We will provide all parties with a trustless and continuous improving auto industry ecosystem. <br/><br/>In the AlphaCar auto industry token economy, the global auto industry will be transformed to be a trustless market from a typical lemon market. All parties in the AlphaCar token ecosystem will be both consumers and stake holders. The network effect will make the value of the AlphaCar community grow exponentially.This positive feedback mechanism will bring about rapid growth of community. This paradigm shift will create a monumental wealth spillover effect, similar to the huge energy release from the process of nuclear fusion. The community members will share the immense wealth generated by the paradigm shift.",
